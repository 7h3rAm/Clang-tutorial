This is a collection of tutorials showing off how to use core Clang types. It is based directly on two older tutorials which no longer built due to code rot.

1. [tutorial 1](http://amnoid.de/tmp/clangtut/tut.html)
2. [tutorial 2](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~laprej/clang.html)

This particular set of tutorials tracks the llvm / clang mainline and is updated semi-regularly to account for llvm / clang API changes.

See contents of the links above for a walkthrough of what these tutorials are doing.

For any questions, please ping me via my github account. Changes and additions are always welcome.
